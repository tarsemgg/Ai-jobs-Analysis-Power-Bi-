Welcome to the fascinating world of AI’s impact on the job market! Your Power BI project sounds both timely and insightful. Let’s dive into the details:

Project Overview
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the influence, acceptance, and effects of AI in current jobs. We’ll explore how AI technologies are being integrated across various sectors, which job roles are most affected, and how these changes impact everyday workers.

Key Questions
Where is AI Being Adopted?
Identify the industries and sectors that are actively embracing AI technologies. Are there any patterns or trends?
Job Roles and AI Integration
Which specific job roles are most impacted by AI adoption? Are certain positions at higher risk of automation?
Effects on Employees
How do employees perceive AI in their workplaces? Is there acceptance or resistance?
What are the potential effects on job satisfaction, workload, and career growth?
Data Analysis
Data Sources
We’ll gather data from reliable sources, such as industry reports, company announcements, and surveys.
Key variables include:
Industry/sector
Job titles/roles
AI adoption level (low, medium, high)
Employee sentiment (acceptance, apprehension, enthusiasm)
Visualizations and Insights
Heatmap of AI Adoption by Industry
A heatmap showing which industries are leading in AI adoption. This helps us understand where AI is making the most significant impact.
Bar Chart: Most Affected Job Roles
Visualize the job roles that are experiencing the highest AI integration. Are administrative roles affected differently from technical roles?
Sentiment Analysis Word Cloud
Use sentiment analysis to extract employee sentiments from text data (e.g., reviews, comments). Create a word cloud to highlight common feelings related to AI.
Line Chart: AI Acceptance Over Time
Track how employee acceptance of AI changes over months or years. Are people becoming more comfortable with AI in the workplace?
Scatter Plot: Job Satisfaction vs. AI Integration
Explore whether job satisfaction correlates with the level of AI integration. Are employees happier in AI-driven roles?
